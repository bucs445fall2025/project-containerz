### Planning

<< Our team's detailed plan to complete the sprint >>
Sam will use the Jest framework to test the frontend for bugs in the logic and UI. Fernando will also use Jest to test the backend logic and database connections. Fernando will work on encrypting the data returned from plaid so that the users data is more secure. 

### Action Items

* Current frontend UI and logic is tested and future logic and UI tests are implementd
* Current backend logic and database connections are tested and future logic and database connections tests are implemented
* Data from plaid is encrypted for enhanced security

### Issues and Risks

* Testing may reveal bugs that will need to be fixed before we can move on to our next steps which will slow us down
* Encrypting the plaid data could add complex logic in order to decrpyt the data to return to the user.

### Team Work Assignments

Fernando:
* Implement encryption and decryption algorithm
* Set up Jest framework for the backend and implement tests

Sam:
