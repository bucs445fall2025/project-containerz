### The summary of the entire project

When the user goes the the analysis tab, a MC simulation is run on their portfolio. When they click on an individual asset, MC is run on the one asset.

## Sprint 10 Planning

## Requirements Flex

4/5 requirement flexes remaining

## Technical Debt

n/a

### Requirement Target

* Fine tuning MC simulation for portfolio
* Fine tuning MC simulation for single asset

### User Stories

* Asset Analysis

### Planning

The current implementation seems to work, but there needs to be more testing done, and we need to refine the code because right now there are some small bugs that don't make any sense. 

### Action Items

* Portfolio simulation refinement
* Single asset simulation refinment

### Issues and Risks

* Bugs are likely to pop up, and we don't have much time left, so most likely we are going to have to end development of this phase soon and really ensure the application works without issues.

### Team Work Assignments

Fernando: portfolio simulation refinement
Sam: single asset simulation refinement
